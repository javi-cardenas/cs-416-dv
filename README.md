# Modern Software Development

This project is an interactive narrative visualization designed to illustrate key insights from the 2024 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. The visualization is implemented using D3.js and follows the slideshow narrative structure to guide the audience through a focused story about modern software development trends before allowing them to explore the data further.

## Overview

The visualization consists of three main scenes:

1. **Developer Compensation by Experience:** This scene explores the relationship between years of professional coding experience and annual compensation, revealing earning patterns across the global developer community.
2. **Popular Programming Languages Worldwide:** This scene focuses on the most widely used programming languages, displaying the top 10 languages by developer adoption.
3. **AI Tool Adoption Interactive Analysis:** This interactive scene allows users to explore how developers are adopting AI tools in their workflow, with the ability to filter by specific tools and see adoption patterns across experience levels.

## Narrative Visualization Techniques

### 1. Messaging

The primary message of this visualization is to convey the current state of the software development industry through three key lenses: compensation trends, technology preferences, and AI adoption. It tells the story of how experience translates to earnings, which technologies dominate the field, and how modern developers are embracing AI tools.

### 2. Narrative Structure

This project follows the **Martini glass** narrative structure:

- **Guided Narrative:** The first two scenes present a guided story, leading the viewer through key insights about developer compensation and language popularity with minimal interaction.
- **Exploration:** The final scene allows users to explore AI adoption data more deeply, selecting specific tools to view detailed adoption patterns.

### 3. Visual Structure

Each scene maintains a consistent visual structure for clarity:

- **Scatter and Bar Charts:** Used to represent data relationships and categorical comparisons effectively.
- **Interactive Tooltips:** Hover interactions provide detailed information about individual data points.
- **Color Encoding:** Strategic use of color to differentiate categories and maintain visual hierarchy.

### 4. Scenes

The visualization is divided into three scenes:

- **Scene 1:** A scatter plot showing the relationship between years of experience and annual compensation, with color coding by country.
- **Scene 2:** A bar chart displaying the top 10 most popular programming languages among developers.
- **Scene 3:** An interactive bar chart showing AI tool adoption patterns, filterable by specific AI tools.

### 5. Annotations

Interactive elements enhance data exploration:

- **Tooltips:** Provide detailed information on hover for all chart elements.
- **Scene Indicators:** Clear navigation showing current progress through the story.
- **Dynamic Labels:** Charts update with contextual axis labels and titles.

### 6. Parameters

The key parameters include:

- **Current Scene:** Tracks the currently displayed scene (1 of 3).
- **Selected AI Tool:** Determines which AI tool's adoption data is shown in the third scene.
- **Data Sample:** Random sampling of 1000 records for optimal performance.
- **Experience Range:** Filters developers with 0-30 years of experience for meaningful analysis.

### 7. Triggers

User interactions drive changes in the visualization:

- **Next/Previous Buttons:** Navigate between scenes with proper state management.
- **AI Tool Dropdown:** Filters data for the selected AI tool in the third scene.
- **Hover Interactions:** Reveal detailed information through tooltips.

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing

- **Smart Sampling:** Loads 1000 random records from the full dataset for performance optimization.
- **Data Cleaning:** Filters out null values, outliers, and invalid entries.
- **Multiple Processing Pipelines:** Different data transformations for each visualization type.
- **Fallback System:** Mock data generator for development and testing.

### Performance Features

- **Modular Architecture:** Reusable chart functions separated into utility modules.
- **Efficient Rendering:** Clear and redraw strategy for smooth scene transitions.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful degradation with fallback data when needed.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly layout with adaptive styling.

## Usage

### Running the Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd cs-416-dv
   ```

2. **Start a local server:**

   ```sh
   npx live-server
   ```

   Or use Python:

   ```sh
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port shown by your server)

### Interacting with the Visualization

- **Scene Navigation:** Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to move through the three scenes.
- **AI Tool Exploration:** In Scene 3, select different AI tools from the dropdown to see adoption patterns.
- **Data Details:** Hover over chart elements to see detailed information in tooltips.
