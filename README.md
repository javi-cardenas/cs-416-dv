## Setup

Install Node.js using Node Version Manager (NVM)...

nvm install
nvm use
```

To run the project...

```sh

```

**(Optional)** To run Python for EDA...

## TODO

make a tree structure for the project folder

## Data

The original and project dataset are contained with the data folder.

# Popular Programming Languages (Bar Chart)

# Popular Developmnet Environments (Maybe Multistacked Bar chart)

# Median years of expperience vs Median salary per language

# Median years of expperience vs Median salary per dev environment

## Martini must go all the way through, only then can they go back to edit

## What is the relationship between programming languages and developer environments?

## I will also assume most people dont use AI and are over the age of 30

### My Hypothesis

Low level language users probably use terminal and are on linux / mac
Higher level language users probably vscode and mac
Windows developers vs Linux/Mac Developers
